        <p><h2>Python®</h2>
            <h2>What</h2>
            Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming <br>
            language with dynamic semantics, used for general-purpose programming. <br>
            It’s everywhere, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not.<br>

            <h2>Who</h2><br>
            Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. <br>
            While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python’s Flying Circus.<br>

            <h2>Why</h2><br>
            Python is omnipresent, and people use numerous Python-powered devices on a daily basis, whether they realize it or not. <br>
            There are billions of lines of code written in Python, which means almost unlimited opportunities for code reuse and learning from well-crafted examples. <br>
            What’s more, there is a large and very active Python community, always happy to help.<br>
            
            There are also a couple of factors that make Python great for learning:<br>
            
            It is easy to learn – the time needed to learn Python is shorter than for many other languages; <br>
            this means that it’s possible to start the actual programming faster;<br>
            It is easy to use for writing new software – it’s often possible to write code faster when using Python;<br>
            It is easy to obtain, install and deploy – Python is free, open and multiplatform; not all languages can boast that.<br>
            Programming skills prepare you for careers in almost any industry, and are required if you want to continue to more advanced and higher-paying software development and engineering roles. <br>
            Python is the programming language that opens more doors than any other. With a solid knowledge of Python, you can work in a multitude of jobs and a multitude of industries. <br>
            And the more you understand Python, the more you can do in the 21st Century. <br>
            Even if you don’t need it for work, you will find it useful to know.</p>
